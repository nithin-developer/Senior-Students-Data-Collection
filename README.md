The Senior Students Data Collection is a PHP project developed by me to facilitate the collection and management of data for senior students. This project consists of two sections: one for junior students and the other for senior students. Junior students can download the data of senior students in CSV format, while senior students have the ability to log in and fill in their data. The project utilizes MySQL for database management.

Features
--------

-   Senior Student Login: The project provides a secure login system for senior students to access their personal data entry section.
-   Data Entry: Senior students can fill in their personal details, academic information, and any other required data using a user-friendly web form.
-   Data Storage: The project uses MySQL to securely store the collected data in a database, ensuring data integrity and availability.
-   Data Retrieval: Junior students can download the data of senior students in CSV format, enabling easy analysis and reporting.
-   Data Validation: The project includes validation checks to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data entered by senior students.
